# Django 3 Refresher

## Inspecting the current Django version, for future development

In this Django Demonstration, the goal was to setup models that demonstrate the use of 1:1, 1:many and many:many relationships.  Then while working with the models, Django rest Framework is user to serialize the data from the models by means of view functions.  Postman was then used to visualize the data in JSON format.

The demonstration also uses secure tokens to facilitate user authentication between the font-end Postman and backend Django.

### Leaning Outcomes

- Using Django 3 as opposed to 2 used in pervious projects
- Customizing the data used in admin to provide better user experiences as opposed to working data from the backend to be represented on a Django's front-end framework.
- Using Django Rest Framework for the first time
- Using Postman to send and receive data from a frontend environment to Django
- Using authentication tokens to enable Django and postman to pass data securely
